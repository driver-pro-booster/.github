# Driver Booster
Driver Booster is a software utility developed by IObit that is designed to help users update their computer's device drivers. Its primary function is to scan your system, identify outdated, missing, or faulty drivers, and then provide a simple way to download and install the latest versions.


The software is marketed as a convenient and easy-to-use solution for improving system performance and stability.

## How Driver Booster Works
Scan: When you run the application, it performs a scan of your computer's hardware.

Identify: It then checks its own large online database of drivers against the drivers currently installed on your system.

Notify: It presents a list of drivers that are either outdated or missing.

Update: With a single click (or a few clicks for individual drivers), you can download and install the new drivers.
## Key Features
- Large Driver Database: IObit claims to have a database of millions of official drivers from over 1,200 hardware manufacturers.

- One-Click Update: It automates the entire process of downloading, installing, and backing up drivers.

- Game-Ready Drivers: It specifically highlights drivers that can enhance gaming performance, such as graphics card drivers, which are critical for many gamers.

- Offline Driver Updater: A feature that allows you to download and install drivers without an internet connection, which can be useful when a network driver is missing.

- System Restore Points: The software typically includes a feature to automatically create a system restore point before installing drivers, providing a way to roll back changes if something goes wrong.

1. Convenience: It saves time and effort by eliminating the need to manually search for and download drivers from various manufacturer websites.
